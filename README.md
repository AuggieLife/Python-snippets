A collection of python snippets that I wrote as a learning process and find useful.

* get_window_list.py - Retrieves a list of open windows and their attributes on a linux system.
* get_mouse_pos.py - Gets the current position of the mouse using Xlib.
* get_mouse_pos_gui.py - Added a Tkinter gui to get_mouse_pos.py.
